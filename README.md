# LibftPlus

LibftPlus is my extended library of 42's libft project.
It'll slowly expand as I go deeper into the 42 Holy Graph with projects
that I make in the 42 curriculum and functions I find useful across projects.

This repo will always be expanding and will truly never be "finished".

# Todo

Comment each function's logic and purpose in the library.
